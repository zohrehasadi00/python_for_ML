    "### Saving Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when working with a machine learning model we will want to save the classifications made by the model for further analysis. In this case, where we have few data points in the test set and our models are fairly simple, we can easily run the model again and less than a second later we have our results, however in practice this is usually not the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will save the classifications made by all three models in a `csv` file, or comma-separated file, `health-test-results.csv`. A `csv` file has two components, the header, and the data. Each line in a `csv` file contains the same number of values which are separated by commas. The header provides a label for the value of each position in each line, and usually indicates something about what these values mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will create a `csv` file with the header:\n",
    "\n",
    "`smoker,age,diet,pred_decision_tree,pred_nearest_neighbor,pred_nearest_mean`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write the function `to_csv` that takes `header` as a fixed argument, and an arbitrary number of arguments afterwards, which should be the data for each column defined in the header. Be sure to check that the number of entries in the header is the same as the number of arbitrary elements passed to the function. The arbitrary elements passed to the function are lists of values for each column, and as such, they should all be the same length. Raise a `ValueError` if either of these are not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Write the function `safe_write` that writes a string to a file. This function should check to see if there already exists a file of the same name and that the name of the output file ends with `.csv`. If the file already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`. If the file name does not end in `.csv`, raise a `ValueError`. Be sure to combine the folder and output file for the full file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Write the function `save_results` that classifies all samples in the test set with each classifier, as is done in `predict_test`, creates a `csv` with `to_csv`, and writes the results to a file using `safe_write`.\n",
    "\n",
